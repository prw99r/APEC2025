# Example 3: Genetc Algorithms

## Example 3.1 An example of optimizationm of random points using a genetic algorithm

### 3.1.1 Files used

ga_linefit.py

### 3.1.2 ga_linefit.py

This python code will create a random function and try to match the function using a genetic algorithm

### 3.1.3 Running the code

To run the code use the following command

python ga_linefit.py

The algorithm will then try and match the line to minimise the error function, with the results as shown below:
